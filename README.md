# TAMMATHON 2025 Project

### This project was created under intense time constraints and insufficient resources.

## Quick Start:

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saifmb0/tammathon2025
    ```
  

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd tammathon2025
    ```

3.  **Run the Python model (Jupyter Notebook):**
    If you have Jupyter installed, you can launch the notebook server and open `model.ipynb`:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    *(If you don't have Jupyter, you'll need to install it first: `pip install jupyter`)*

    Alternatively, if you want to execute it directly (though this is less common for `.ipynb` files and might require `nbconvert` or similar tools for full execution):
    ```bash
    python model.ipynb
    ```
    *(Note: Directly running `.ipynb` files with `python` might not execute all cells as expected without proper tooling like `nbconvert`.)*

## Additional Notes:

* A `.csv` combiner was created to combine output from multiple machines due to time constraints.
